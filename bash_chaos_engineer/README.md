# "Chaos Engineer" and the "SysAdmin"

This is a fantastic way to learn. Instead of just following a tutorial, you are the "Chaos Engineer" and the "SysAdmin" at the same time. Setting up the break yourself actually teaches you more about the underlying system than just fixing it.

## Course Overview: Happy Server (DevOps Edition)

How we will proceed:
Since you are the one controlling the VM, we will do this "Sad Servers" style.

The Sabotage: I will give you a script or a set of commands to run that will "break" your Ubuntu VM in a specific way.

The Brief: I will explain the "symptoms" (e.g., "The boss says the website is down").

The Fix: You will use your terminal to diagnose and fix it.

The Report: You tell me how you fixed it, and I’ll critique your method or offer a "Pro-Tip" shortcut.

Would you like to start with Chapter 1 (The Mystery of the Missing Space) and get the sabotage instructions for your VM?
